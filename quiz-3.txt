Q: What is the type of this variable? const fruitSweetness = 80;
A: Number

Q: Why don't I have to use any type annotations with this function?
const fruitList = [
  {
    name: "Apple",
    color: "red",
  },
  {
    name: "Banana",
    color: "yellow",
  },
  {
    name: "Cherry",
    color: "red",
  },
];

const filteredFruit = fruitList.filter((fruit) => fruit.color === "red")
A: TypeScript is able to infer the type of the callback's parameters since we pass the callback function directly to the filter method.
