A: props, state

Q: What is wrong with this React component?
interface CounterState {
  count: number;
}
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state: CounterState = {count: 0};
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button
          onClick={() => this.setState(({count}) => ({count: count + 1}))}
        >
          +
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
A: We didn't provide a generic argument for state, so this.setState doesn't know the type of this.state.
