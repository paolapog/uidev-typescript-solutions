Q: What is the difference between these two event handlers?
  function handleOnChange(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>):void {
    // ...
  }
  const handleOnChange:ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement> = (event) => {
    // ...
  }
A: Not one thing is different. They are effectively equivalent.

Q: What is the purpose of typeof event.target in this block of code?
function handleClick(
  event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>
) {
  const target = event.target as typeof event.target & ExtraProperties;
  
  // ...
}
A: It includes all of the existing properties in event.target, so the ExtraProperties interface can be added to them.
