Q: What is the type of the contextValue variable?
const ThemeModeContext = createContext("dark")

const App = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(ThemeModeContext);
  // ...
}
A: string

Q: Why do you have to be extra careful when initializing context using the code below?
const ThemeModeContext = createContext<ThemeModeInterface>(undefined!);
A: Our context initializes as undefined, but we are telling TypeScript that it has a value. If we access this context outside of a provider tree, the value of our context will be undefined, but TypeScript will think that it is ThemeModeInterface.
