Q: What are the two biggest contributors to TypeScript's strange behavior? Select two answers.
A: Structural Typing, Type Erasure

Q: Why shouldn't I ever use an empty interface, such as the one below?
interface Empty {}
A: It doesn't have any properties, so you can assign anything to it. It's like any, but more dangerous.

Q: Why can I pass a function with only one parameter to a callback that expects a function with three parameters?
A: TypeScript doesn't care how many of the parameters that we use in our callback function; only that the parameters that we do use have the correct type.
